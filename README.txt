This is my solution in C to the Paging Lab given in the Operating Systems class at NYU CAS Fall 2019. 
Repo includes: input/outputs, my solution, paging lab instructions.
Score 100/100.

To compile run the command: gcc Pager.c
To test the inputs run the command ./a.out <input-file>
Replace <input-file> with the file you want to test from the lab instructions e.g. 10 10 20 1 10 lru 0 for input1
